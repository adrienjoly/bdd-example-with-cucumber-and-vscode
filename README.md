I'm discovering BDD (Behavior Driven Development) with Benjamin Hugot, using Cucumber/Gherkin and JavaScript.

Topic: implement the "Pandemic" game.

Rules of the game:

- in French: http://lardj.free.fr/docs/Regles/pandemie.pdf
- in English: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RxqzBA_HRs

How to run the tests?

```sh
$ nvm use # to use the version of node.js specified in .nvmrc
$ npm install
$ npm test
```

You should get:

```
..

1 scenario (1 passed)
2 steps (2 passed)
```
